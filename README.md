This project focused on examining the relationship between soil quality, the Air Quality Index (AQI), and the Water Quality Index (WQI). By analyzing environmental data, we explored how anthropogenic activities—such as industrial waste disposal, deforestation, and excessive use of fertilizers—contribute to soil degradation and, in turn, affect air and water pollution levels.
Key methods included:
### ✔ Data Collection & Processing: Sourcing soil, air, and water quality data from regional environmental monitoring systems.
### ✔ Statistical Analysis: Identifying correlations between soil parameters (e.g., pH, organic content, heavy metal concentrations) and pollution indices (AQI, WQI).
### ✔ Geospatial & Temporal Analysis: Mapping pollution hotspots and examining seasonal variations.
### ✔ Impact Assessment: Evaluating the extent to which soil degradation contributes to air and water pollution trends.

Soil, air, and water quality are deeply interconnected, with fertilizer overuse acting as a key link between them. Excessive application of nitrogen-rich fertilizers (e.g., Urea, DAP) increases soil contamination by raising NPK levels. 
These nutrients leach into water bodies, leading to eutrophication, oxygen depletion, and aquatic ecosystem degradation. Simultaneously, fertilizer emissions release ammonia and nitrates into the atmosphere, worsening air pollution by contributing to acid rain, ozone depletion, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) formation. Poor air quality, in turn, affects soil health by altering pH and reducing organic content
